# Spigot plugin.yml Annotations

_Inspired by Spigot plugin-annotations_

The Spigot team create annotations to programmatically generate the `plugin.yml` file required for Minecraft Plugins.

Honestly I had some personal reservations about the structure of the `plugin-annotations` project, and believed I could
do better. And in my opinion, I did. There were some annotations that were not configured correctly, and the processor
was a mess.

Since I did use their codebase as a starting point to understand what annotations they provided and how they were being
processed, I have included their MIT code license in this module.
